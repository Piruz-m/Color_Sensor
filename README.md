# Color_Sensor
An RGB led is set to emit blue, green and red light in succession, each lasting for a period of 500 ms, with a period of 500 ms in between the bursts, where no light is emitted. An ldr is used to measure the light intensity during each burstAn object is placed in front of the ldr, which is enclosed by a tube black PVC tape on the sides, to prevent ambient light interference. When the light reflects off the object, onto the ldr, the colour received that will be of highest intensity will be the colour of the object. An algorithm is used to detect 8 colours- red, green, blue, yellow, magenta, cyan, violet and orange. This particular algorithm, measures the brightest and second brightest colour and stores it in some variables, using counters. After the sum of these counters reaches 12, it is reset. This is done, to improve the accuracy of the ldr sensor readings and to obtain information about colours other than RGB. Depending on the ratio of the RGB counters after their sum reaches 12, the algorithm decides on a colour. The accuracy of this sensor could be improved further, by increasing the threshold for reset, but that would increase the time required for detection as well.  The microcontroller used for the project is node mcu
